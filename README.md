  A (sovereign) rollup for on Ethereum.
</p>
<br />

The `sovereign` repository contains all the code for running a rollup on Ethereum.

Black Heap is an egalitarian and technocratic network collective in which anyone is can join and contribute to.

## Rationale

With the cryptocurrency developments in the last decade and the recent formulization of [the network state](https://thenetworkstate.com), it has been made possible to achieve collective sovereignty on the internet. Although, how does the collective take on a form of identity? This can be through Discord, Twitter, Group Chats and/or other mediums. We at Black Heap, believe that a blockchain (in this case a rollup) is the right foundation for an eventual network state.

## Tokenomics

Black Heap introduces a fairly launched cryptocurrency, `HEAP`, and is used as gas for the rollup.
